# RTSS-2019-WIP
A brief presentation for RTSS 2019 (2020.2.18-21, York).

Unfortunately, some codes (resampling and split the raw ECG to 256-dot segments, implementing a pytorch ResNet) may be lost in a winter. The server was dead since the author was unaware that the CPU FAN fails to cleave to the CPU. 

The author promises to reproduce the code by 2022.
